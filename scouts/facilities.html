                            <p>Camp Harris is situated 8 kilometres from Cole Harbour (intersection of Cole Harbour and Forest Hills Drive) along the Lawrencetown Highway #207, turning inland for 1.2 kilometres along the Mineville Road to civic address #1250/1260. From Highway #107 take exit #18, drive for 4.4 kms to civic address #1250/1260. The Camp is a forested property on 40 acres of land, with only a few acres cleared to provide space for buildings and parking. There is limited walk-in access to a lake and a number of short trails. </p>
                            <p>The Camp is surrounded on all sides by private property (for example, the access road from the Mineville Road is owned by a neighbour; Scouts Canada only has a right-of-way). The untended telephone at the Camp is listed under Scouts Canada in the telephone book (902-434-2684). At any time the camp is in use there is a Duty Scouter on call. The Duty Scouter can be reached by calling 902-221-0284.</p>
                            <p>There are various facilities available for use by "campers" (this being the generic term used hereafter for persons using the Camp for any purpose).</p>

                            <p>Water in the wash rooms is unfiltered and only suitable for washing. There is an outside tap at the MacMillan building for use by groups camping out. This water is suitable for drinking and cooking. All water quality is tested quarterly by the QE II Health Sciences Centre Path Lab, with the results held by the Camp Committee. Occasionally the water to one of the buildings may freeze up during cold weather and water may have to be carried from another building.</p>
                            <p>A check with the Camp Registrar before going into Camp will determine the status of water in Camp.</p>

                                <li>Because of the great demand for use of Camp facilities, the following procedures are used to regulate bookings. The Booking year for the camp is a 13 month period; September 1st of the current calendar year, to September 31st of the following calendar year.</li>
                                <li>Dartmouth Area event bookings for the next Booking year shall be provided to the Camp Registrar no later than June 30th of the current calendar year and will be confirmed once received.</li>
                                <li>All Groups or Organizations who are making a booking for ‘All Facilities’ can do so up to one full calendar year in advance of the date(s) they are booking. Confirmation will be provided, subject to availability.</li>
                                <li>During the week prior to Labor Day, any Dartmouth Area Section or Group which has completed a minimum of 25 service hours to the camp may request one booking for facilities. Confirmation will be provided subject to availability.</li>
                                <li>From Labor Day until Thanksgiving Monday in October, each Dartmouth Area Section or Group may request one booking for facilities. Confirmation will be provided subject to availability.</li>
                                <li>After the Thanksgiving Monday in October, Dartmouth Area Sections or Groups may request additional bookings for facilities still available. Confirmation will be provided, subject to availability.</li>
                                <li>A booking of any facility may be made by any Organization or Group outside of Dartmouth Area at any time. The booking will be tentative and confirmation of booking will occur following Thanksgiving Monday, subject to availability as per (e) above. </li>
                                <li>All Groups, Sections, Area, or Organizations must provide the Camp Registrar with two weeks advance notice of any cancellation of a booking. Cancellation fees shall be determined by the Camp Harris Committee as identified in the ‘Notes’ section below.</li>

                                    <li>If a Group, Section, Area, or Organization cannot use a reservation as made, they are asked to call and cancel as quickly as possible, so as to free up the facility for others to use. If a booking is cancelled less than two weeks prior to date(s) booked then the Group, Section, Area, or Organization shall be liable for the cost of one night’s fee per facility booked. The Camp Committee reserves the right to wave this fee under special circumstances. </li>

                            <p>These guideline are issued under the authority of the Provincial Council by the Camp Harris Camp Committee, for the safety and benefit of all campers, and for conservation of the Camp. They apply to all persons using the Camp (ie, from individual camper visits, to Provincial, Area, Group, and Section activities). They are updated frequently.

                                <li>The Scout Law and the rules for camping in Scouts Canada BP&amp;P shall guide all campers when using the Camp. In particular all registered youth must be supervised by at least one adult when on a camping visit to the Camp. The adult to youth ratios as per B.P. &amp; P. must be met at all times.</li>
                                <li>To prevent difficulties between groups when staying at the Camp, campers are requested to use only those areas specifically allocated for their use. When sharing facilities (eg, washrooms and campfire pits), cooperation is expected between groups. As per the Scout Law, all campers must respect and be considerate of the rights of campers from other groups.</li>
                                <li>The Camp Committee is in charge of all aspects of the Camp property, and operates under the guidance of the Provincial Council. There are two positions on the Camp Committee for representatives from each of the former Districts / Zones that Dartmouth was divided into, at least one of whom shall be a program Scouter.</li>

                            <p>The Camp is looked after by volunteers from throughout Area on a two month rotational basis. The duties of the Area volunteers are as follows:</p>

                                <li>Turn on the heat and water in the buildings as required by weather conditions (ie, in the late autumn and winter) prior to the arrival of campers</li>
                                <li>Ensure stoves, fridges and hot water heaters are in good working order prior to the arrival of campers</li>
                                <li>Ensure information is left for campers regarding these guidelines, and other restrictions laid down from time to time (ie, boil water order, fire ban, trail closures) by the Camp Committee</li>
                                <li>Sign out and sign in to/from campers items of general Camp equipment which MAY be available (eg, tools, axes, shovels) on an exception basis. (Campers should normally bring everything that they might need)</li>
                                <li>Check all buildings and facilities occupied by campers to ensure that they have been properly cleaned</li>
                                <li>Turn down heat in the buildings and drain the water systems as required by cold weather</li>
                                <li>Be available via the Camp cell phone to assist campers in distress (eg, reset master propane shut-off valves and relight propane systems)</li>
                                <li>Advise the Camp Committee of any significant breeches of Camp Guidelines at the earliest convenient occasion</li>
                                <li>Perform any minor maintenance (change light bulbs, etc.) within their capabilities. This includes keeping all lawns mowed and doors ways shoveled in season</li>

                            <p>In view of the limited road access to the buildings in the main area of the Camp in the event of an emergency, the Fire Marshall requires us to respect the need for "fire lanes" around all buildings. To that end:</p>

                                <li>When parking, campers are requested to make room for the maximum number of cars</li>

In the winter there is absolutely no parking/stopping on the road outside the Dixon Centre. Campers are encouraged to check with the Camp Committee and/or Camp Registrar before an event to determine what parking restrictions are in effect, so that they can pass along the word to all leaders and parents driving out to the Camp. Campers must accept that they may need to transport food and equipment by toboggan down from the parking lot, for the safety of all</li>

                            <p>Just as the Camp Committee has responsibilities to campers for the proper maintenance of the Camp, so to do campers have responsibilities when using the facilities, to other campers now and in the future.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5><strong>Copies of the Guidelines:</strong> These Guidelines should be taken by campers to the Camp (copies are provided in each building in the Camp), read by all leaders attending Camp, briefed as appropriate to the youth, and abided by to the greatest extent possible.</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>Arrival at Camp: The following is important when arriving at the Camp:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Campers should check the condition of the buildings they will be using on arrival, and report any anomalies to the volunteer Scouter on call for the weekend or the Camp Committee Chair as soon as practically possible.</li>
                                <li>As soon as practical, Leaders should brief all youth on fire escape procedures, on the location of the camper's First Aid Kit, on Camp boundaries (marked by yellow signs on trees), on the location of key facilities to be used (and not to use other facilities not assigned for their use), on water for drinking, and on other matters of significance to the group itself.</li>
                                <li>Once gear and food is dropped off, campers shall remove vehicles to the main parking lots.</li>
                                <li>Camp Users are responsible for clearing snow from doorways, stairs, and ramps of the facilities they are using, and must ensure that these areas kept clear during their stay. Shovels are provided in each of the main buildings during winter camping season. </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><strong>Hygiene: Campers shall take appropriate steps to maintain high standards of hygiene. In this regard, the following guidelines are important:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Garbage shall be disposed of "off-site" by campers. By "off-site" is meant that it is removed to a location where there is regular garbage pick-up (eg, take it home). Under no circumstances is it to be left at the Mineville Road box (which belongs to and is paid for by the neighbor). For long term camps, garbage disposal should be done every two days; for short term camps, garbage is to be taken off-site when departing. Everything brought to the Camp by campers is to be removed by them.</li>
                                <li>Washrooms are to be cleaned and re-supplied at least daily (or as may be required in exceptional circumstances) by those using the facilities, and before departing the Camp. Normally, those campers using Wright and/or Dixon use and clean the washrooms in Delaney, whereas campers in MacMillan and Evans use and clean the washrooms in MacMillan. Outdoor campers are to clean the vault toilets. Cleaning is to include sweeping and mopping the floor and cleaning all fixtures (ie, toilets, urinals, counters and sinks), as well as ensuring an adequate supply of toilet paper.</li>
                                <li>Campers are required to bring to Camp all cleaning materials and paper goods (eg, toilet paper, dish soap, javex) that they will need to ensure a high standard of hygiene.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><strong>Kitchens/Cooking: As per Scouting routine and to ensure maximum  safety, the following guidelines pertaining to kitchens and cooking should be observed by campers:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li> The water supply is limited, as it comes from drilled wells. All water consumption should therefore be monitored to safeguard campers and prevent waste (ie, usage of basins in sinks rather than filling the sinks).</li>
                                <li>Kitchen areas should be out-of-bounds to all campers except those preparing meals. Kitchens should not be used for program planning or activities.</li>
                                <li>Propane stoves are for cooking purposes only. The range hood exhaust fans above the ranges MUST always be turned on when the ranges are in use. For safety reasons, the stoves should not be used to heat buildings or dry clothes.</li>
                                <li>The propane stoves in the MacMillan, Dixon and Wright buildings are fitted with an automatic fire suppression system in the range hoods</li>
                                <li>All kitchen equipment shall be cleaned immediately after use.</li>
                                <li>The four tub method of washing dishes should be used (first tub, use rubber gloves in very hot water and dish soap; the second tub for hot water rinse; and the third tub, hot water and one cap of javex) followed by air drying. The fourth sink is for hand washing.</li>
                                <li>Grease should be collected in tin cans or other containers and disposed of (once solidified) as garbage (not in the forest). Grease should never be poured down the sink drains or toilets as it upsets the balance of nature in the septic systems.</li>
                                <li>A composter is available behind MacMillan, but it must strictly be used in accordance with appropriate composting guidelines.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><strong>Alcohol/Drugs:</strong> The use or possession of any form of unlawful drugs on camp property is forbidden. The use or possession of alcohol beverages is mandated by BPnP 1010(a)(b).</p>
                            <p><strong>Firearms/Pyrotechnics:</strong> Guns, including pellet and BB guns, are not permitted at the Camp, nor are explosive devices such as rockets and fireworks.</p>
                            <p><strong>Smoking:</strong> There should be no smoking in areas used by youth.</p>
                            <p><strong>Trees:</strong> Live trees shall not be damaged or felled except for site clearing approved by the Camp Committee. Downed timber can be disposed of as firewood; stumps can be cut off at ground level for the same purpose.</p>

                                <li>At any time that a building fire alarm system sounds, regardless of cause (eg, even if caused by burning food on the stove), the building should be evacuated immediately to an outdoor Muster Point location, as identified on the building evacuation plan, and a roll call taken. This is important to condition all youth to react the same way at all times.</li>
                                <li>The fire department must be telephoned using the emergency number 911. The Civic Address of the Camp is 1250 Mineville Road.</li>

                                <li>The Duty Service Scouter must be informed whenever one of the building fire alarms are set off, using the cell phone number 902-221-0284.</li>
                                <li>Outdoor fires shall be confined to the existing fire pits agreed to by the Camp Committee, and are to be left unattended only when they are "dead out".
